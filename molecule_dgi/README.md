# Representation learning of molecular graphs by mutual information maximization


This repository provides the codes on my personal project, "representation learning of molecular graphs by mutual information maximization". \
This project is ongoing, I did not see very interesting results on improving molecular property predictions with semi-supervised learning fashion. \
I would be more than happy to recieve any comments. \
Also, If you want to contribute or to cowork with me, please feel free to give me a message via e-mail in the most-front of my github page.
