# Representation learning by predictive coding

This repository provides codes reproducing two papers, "[Representation learning by contrastive predictive coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748)" and "[Wasserstein dependency measure for representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11780)". 

### Overall scheme

As shown in the above figure, the convolutional encoder and the GRU-RNN blocks produce ![](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1570607635/eqn.png) and $$c_t$$, respectively.
