# Representation learning by predictive coding

This repository provides codes reproducing "Representation learning by contrastive predictive coding" and "Wasserstein dependency measure for representation learning". 

### Overall scheme

As shown in the above figure, the two moduels -- the convolutional encoder and the GRU-RNN -- produce $z_t$ and $c_t$, respectively.
