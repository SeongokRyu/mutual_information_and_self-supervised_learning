# Representation learning by predictive coding

This repository provides codes reproducing "[Representation learning by contrastive predictive coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748)" and "[Wasserstein dependency measure for representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11780)". 

### Overall scheme

As shown in the above figure, the two moduels -- the convolutional encoder and the GRU-RNN -- produce $$ z_t $$ and $$ c_t $$, respectively.
