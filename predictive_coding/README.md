# Representation learning by predictive coding

This repository provides codes reproducing two papers, "[Representation learning by contrastive predictive coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748)" and "[Wasserstein dependency measure for representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11780)". 

This personal project aims to show
* Successful implementation and comparison of self-supervised learning by contrastive/Wasserstein predictive coding. 
* Comparison of the classification accuracy of supervised learning and semi-supervised learning results. 
* Comparison of the methods enforcing 1-Lipschitz continuity: spectral normalization and gradient penalty methods. 

## How to use
*Placeholder -- will be updated as soon as possible*
